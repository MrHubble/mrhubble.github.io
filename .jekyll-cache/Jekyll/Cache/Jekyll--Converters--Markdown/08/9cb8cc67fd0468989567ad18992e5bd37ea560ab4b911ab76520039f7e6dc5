I"¹<p>We had a need for an â€œoffline firstâ€ mobile app. Being part of a small team, if we can make this app utilising much of our existing codebase then all the better.</p>

<p>With the release of Turbolinks 5 came the release of the iOS and Android native wrappers for using your existing codebase with Turbolinks to release a hybrid app.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, at this point in time (Jan, 2018),Â Â <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorker">ServiceWorkers currently arenâ€™t supported on iOS or Android webviews</a> , so it canâ€™t be used in combination with Turbolinks for offline first apps.</p>

<p>We instead decided to use React Native withÂ <a href="https://realm.io/products/realm-database">Realm Database</a>Â and our existing Rails API.</p>
